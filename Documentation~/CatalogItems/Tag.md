# Tags

## Overview

A __Tag__ provides a way to tag [catalog items].
There are many reasons to use __tags__.
You may want to regroup them and find all the items having a particular __tag__ using the [Inventory Manager], or enable a game feature for only items having a certain __tag__.
A [catalog item] can have as many __tags__ as needed.

It is identified by a string `id`.

## Editor Overview

The __Tags__ tab is visible for each type of [catalog item].
